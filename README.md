Anomaly Detection
==============================

The real world does not slow down for bad data

1. Download the benchmark data set from https://www.kaggle.com/boltzmannbrain/nab or https://github.com/numenta/NAB/tree/master/data
2. Load the one of the data set into panda data frames
3. Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
4. Build one or more anomaly detection models to determine the anomalies using the other columns as features
